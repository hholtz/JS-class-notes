Length
  name.length
  "Hannah".length

Math
  3 + 4
  12 / 4

Reference Error
  Get this when something is undefined, like typing only `eggplant`

Interactive JS
  Confirmation Messages/Pop Ups
    ex: confirm("I am awesome!");
  Prompts/Question Box
    ex: prompt("What is your name?");

Data Types
  1) Numbers - ex: 4, 10
  2) Strings - to create one just put quotes around it, ex: "Hannah", can do "Hey I'm Hannah".length > this includes spaces
  3) Boolean - true/false,  ex: true or 4> 2

    practice: "Hey I'm Hannah".length = 14      14 > 10 = true

Console.log
  Prints out whatever is in the parentheses
  ex: console.log(2*5)  = 10
  ex: console.log("Hello World")

List of comparison operators:
  > Greater than   < Less than  <= Less than or equal to  >= Greater than or equal to   === Equal to  !== Not equal to

If, Else
    # ex: if("Hannah".length >= 2){
      console.log("You have a long name")
      }

    # ex: if("myName".length >= 2){
      console.log("You have a long name")
      }
      else {
      console.log("You have a short name")
      }

    # ex: if (12 / 4 === "Ari".length) {
    confirm("Will this run the first block?");
    } else {
    confirm("Or the second block?");
    }

Math
    Use PEMDAS just like in math class

Modulo
      - When % is placed between two numbers, the computer will divide the first number by the second, and then return the remainder of that division.
        ex: 23 % 10 = 3
        ex: console.log(14 % 3) = 2
        ex: 9 % 3 = 0
        ex: `10 % 2 === 0`   = true

Module + If/Else
    ex:
      if(8 % 2 === 0) {
        console.log("The first number is even");
      } else {
        console.log("The first number is odd");
      }

Substring
    - this is like how Gmail only shows you a preview of a new message

    -  "some word".substring(x, y)
          - x is where you start chopping
          - y is where you finish chopping the original string

      to select "he" in "hello", you would write this
          "hello".substring(0, 2);

    - each character in a string is numbered starting at 0
        ex: h e l l o
            0 1 2 3 4

            but to slice after the "e", you actually need to slice up to position 2 > (0,2)

        ex: From 4th to 6th letter of "laptop"
            "laptop".substring(3, 6);

            it's weird because you chop at 6 to include the 6th letter, but remember that the first letter is 0, so you are chopping before the 8th letter really

        ex: "Melbourne is" in "Melbourne is great" (note the space)
            console.log("Melbourne is great".substring(0, 12));


        ex: "burgers" in "Hamburgers"
            console.log("Hamburgers".substring(3, 10));
